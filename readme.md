# ccsv

This was meant to be a C library for parsing .csv files, written for the purpose of improving my skills in this language. While I have failed dismally in my efforts (cira. Jan 2025), I will tackle this once again when my capabilities have expanded. I started learning C yesterday, so I guess failure is to be expected.

For now, I was able to print out the headers of the file ratings.csv. You will find that it works when other files from the /data folder are substituted as well.
